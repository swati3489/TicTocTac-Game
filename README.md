# TicTocTac-Game
Creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript is a fun and interactive project
Theory
Game Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Two players take turns marking a square with "X" or "O".
The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
Core Concepts
HTML: Provides the game structure (grid).
CSS: Styles the game board and marks.
JavaScript: Implements game logic and interactivity (player turns, checking for wins, etc.).
